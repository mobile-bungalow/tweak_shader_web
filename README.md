# Tweak Shader Web

This is a web utility for writing shaders compatibel with [tweak shader](https://github.com/mobile-bungalow/tweak_shader), allowing them to be run in after effects with the [tweak shader plugin](https://github.com/mobile-bungalow/tweak_shader_ae_plugin). As of writing the utility only works on chrome and unstable releases of other browsers.

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

```
